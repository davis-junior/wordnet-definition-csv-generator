# Description
This script gets WordNet definitions of words supplied by a file and creates a csv of word to definition. Mainly for use with Anki, but the output csv is very general and has nothing specific for Anki, so it could have other uses.

# How to Use
Create a file containing the words you want defined. Delimit with newline character.

Simply call the script with -i or --input, passing the file with words. The script will then create an output file with a similar name and .csv extension.

I personally use this script to import the generated csv into Anki.
